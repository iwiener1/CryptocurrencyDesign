1. If a user attempts to spend more than a quarter of their current balance at once, an extra 10% is added to the fee to be transferred to a random person holding less cryptocurrency than the 10% extra fee. If no such person exists, it is transferred to the creator of the cryptocurrency (an address defined in the constructor).
2. Anytime a user spends less than a quarter of their current balance, there is a 5% chance that the person holding the lowest positive amount of the coin gets transferred the money instead.
3. Whenever someone tries to send the currency to a different address, if that address has more of the currency than the address sending the currency, the receiving address instead receives half the initial amount sent and the other half is sent to a random person holding less currency than the sender. If no such address exists, instead send the other half to the creator of the currency.
